  description: [
    "Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student, manages to survive a vampire attack with the help of Meme Oshino, a strange man residing in an abandoned building. Though being saved from vampirism and now a human again, several side effects such as superhuman healing abilities and enhanced vision still remain. Regardless, Araragi tries to live the life of a normal student, with the help of his friend and the class president, Tsubasa Hanekawa.",
    "When fellow classmate Hitagi Senjougahara falls down the stairs and is caught by Araragi, the boy realizes that the girl is unnaturally weightless. Despite Senjougahara's protests, Araragi insists he help her, deciding to enlist the aid of Oshino, the very man who had once helped him with his own predicament.",
    "Through several tales involving demons and gods, Bakemonogatari follows Araragi as he attempts to help those who suffer from supernatural maladies.",

        "You don’t have to be a member of the anime community for long to know that the Monogatari series is very, very highly praised. Inevitably, I gave into the hype and tried it out for myself. The result? Well… I walked away entertained, but FAR from impressed. Yes the characters are amusing, yes the dialogue is witty, and yes the visuals are beautiful, but make no mistake: Bakemonogatari is just a harem. It exists only for comedic gags and fanservice. The characters are shallow and have little to offer beyond their archetypes and their dialogue, not to mention that the “plot” is loose and unimpressive to say the least. I guess I have very mixed feelings about this anime; I’m happy I watched it, but the people hailing it as a masterpiece need to check themselves.",
        `Synopsis: Koyomi Araragi, our harem lead, gets himself involved with all sorts of supernatural stuff, including vampires, spirits, myths, ghosts, and other apparitions. Being the overly selfless, and unreasonably nice harem lead that he is, Araragi meets a series of girls, each of which with their own problems. He finds a way to solve those problems, thus making essentially all of those girls fall in love with him until he has his very own harem.`,
        "Now, you’ve probably heard that sort of plot premise many times before, and that’s because there is nothing unique about this show’s plot what so ever. Even the supernatural thing has been done before. It’s quite simply a show about a boy helping girls with their problems one by one, a-la every visual novel ever made (even though this show is not based on a VN). There really isn’t much to say about it except one thing: Holy shit is there dialogue. Now, that’s not necessarily a bad thing; lots of my favorite anime are considered dialogue heavy, but Bakemongatari is essentially “Dialogue: The Animation”. Granted, it's usually very witty and well-written dialogue, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't lose interest on more than one occasion. I really enjoyed the action scenes because of how incredibly animated they are, but they were few and far between to say the least. You can count them on one hand. In short, this plot is just a bare-minimum narrative framework for the show to conduct comedic gags and show tons of fanservice all the while attempting to incorporate every otaku fetish ever conceived. Needless to say, the plot is NOT the reason to watch this show…",

        "Author's note: Please don't take this review too seriously. This is merely describing my own painful experience with this show. I'm not personally attacking Monogatari fans! Thank you.",
        `Bakemonogatari is generally hailed as a masterpiece for being bold, innovative, challenging, and overall an unforgettably unique experience. While all of these things are certainly true, it is only a partial truth. Those above listed traits would all describe Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi, but Bakemonogatari is QUITE different from those series. Tatami's philosophy, comedy, and characters can transcend the language boundary. This is also true for Mushishi with its amazing visuals and atmosphere. Bakemonogatari though, is a series in which full mastery of the Japanese language is an absolute necessity. It feels that roughly 90% of Bakemonogatari's value and 100% of it's enjoyment is based on clever prose and wordplay that doesn't translate outside of Japanese. There is a reason this series will NEVER be dubbed. I feel that Bakemonogatari lovers can be neatly divided into 2 categories: those fluent in Japanese and fucking liars!`,
        `Have you ever wondered why novels have widespread appeal outside of their countries of origin and poetry typically doesn't? People aren't kidding when they say things get "lost in translation". Prose that is immensely intricate in its original form will often get butchered into something clunky and brutal. The English speaking world fell in love with Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through the translations of Constance Garnett, who is considered by some to have been a sub-par translator that eviscerated the original Russian. It didn't matter because the characters, themes, psychology, etc was able to shine through. Even if it kind of sounded crappy and had awkward sentences. The poetry of Alexander Pushkin though has never really found as much fanfare outside of Russia. While we can certainly appreciate his brilliant narrative poems like The Bronze Horseman and Evgeny Onegin, we non-Russian speakers can't seem to really understand his prose and just what makes it so "good" to Russian ears. Similarly, Bakemonogatari to a non-Japanese speaker like me has all the appeal of listening to Igbo or Yoruba poetry while nodding my head and pretending to understand because I want to be smart.`,
